# GeoPix Framework for Subsurface Reservoir Characterization

## Overview
The **GeoPix Framework** leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the Pix2Pix model, to generate high-resolution property maps such as porosity and permeability from facies images. This model is designed to improve subsurface reservoir characterization by providing more accurate predictions of rock properties.

## Network Architecture

### Generator
- A **U-Net-based architecture** designed to generate property maps (e.g., porosity, permeability) from facies input images.
- The U-Net structure allows for high-quality image-to-image translation by combining convolutional layers with skip connections.

### Discriminator
- A **PatchGAN-based convolutional network** used to evaluate the realism of the generated property maps.
- It operates on image patches to ensure that both global structure and local texture are realistic.

## Key Features
- **Data-Driven Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict rock properties directly from geological facies data.
- **Robust Performance**: The combination of U-Net and PatchGAN improves the generation of high-resolution, geologically plausible property maps.
- **Application in Reservoir Characterization**: The model aids in better understanding subsurface formations, which is critical for hydrocarbon exploration and production.
